- title: "What does it mean to be a Bible First coach?"
  answer: >
    <p>Essentially, a Bible First coach is any individual or organization who
    is managing their own correspondence ministry using Bible First materials.
    As a coach, you are taking on the full responsibility for any students you
    enroll. This includes sending and receiving lessons, grading, answering
    Bible questions, and in general doing all you can to bring your students to
    Christ.</p>
    <p>To gain a fuller understanding of what it means to manage your own Bible
    First ministry, we strongly encourage you to watch our Bible First training
    videos.</p>

- title: "How many copies of which lessons should I order as I start out?"
  answer: >
    <p>Ultimately this is up to you, but we recommend that you order at least
    seven copies of each of the first two volumes. That way, you’ll qualify for
    bulk pricing. Additionally, you’ll be sure to have plenty of materials on
    hand as you enroll your first students.</p>
    <p>As a general rule of thumb, we have found it best to keep about twice the
    number of Volume 1 booklets on hand as any other booklet. The reason for
    this is that if a student decides to drop out, he will usually do so
    sometime in the early stages of the course. As a result, you'll find
    yourself sending out more copies of Volume 1 than of the later volumes.</p>
