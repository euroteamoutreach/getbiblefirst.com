#### Introduction

The primary goal of the Bible is to introduce the reader to the Author. God Almighty, the Creator of all that is, desires that we would have a personal relationship with Him. In order for us to know Him, God has provided an accurate picture of who He is in the Bible. Although it is impossible to thoroughly explore God in only one lesson, this study will provide a general introduction to God&apos;s nature.
