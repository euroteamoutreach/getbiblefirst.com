### Lesson 10: Noah and the Great Flood

* The Righteous Judgment of God* Noah, the Preacher of Righteousness* The Great Flood* The Tower of Babel* God’s Provision for Deliverance from Judgment

#### Introduction

As men multiplied on the earth, so did their transgressions against the Lord. By the time of Noah, the human race had so corrupted itself that, in the words of the Bible, *"…every imagination of the thoughts of [their] heart was only evil continually." (Genesis 6:5)* The remainder of Genesis 6 describes God’s response to this evil: the greatest cataclysmic event in the history of the world. However, this record is more than a narrative of judgment. It paints a picture of the vast mercy of God, extended to all who will come to Him in faith.
