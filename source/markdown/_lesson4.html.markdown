#### Introduction

In the previous three lessons we examined the origin of the Bible (Lesson 1), the nature of God (Lesson 2), and the role played by spirit beings (Lesson 3). Having established this foundation we are now ready to embark on our journey through the book of Genesis. As you progress through the remainder of the lessons in this course, you will often be asked to stop and read a passage from the Bible before continuing. These preliminary reading assignments are important as they reinforce a proper approach to Bible study: first we consider the Scriptures themselves, and only after careful examination of the text do we expand our study to investigate the writings of others.
