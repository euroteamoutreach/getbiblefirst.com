### Lesson 13: Sodom and Gomorrah

* God's Visit to Abraham* Abraham’s Intercession for Sodom* Homosexuality in the Bible* Lot's Rescue from Sodom* The Destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah* Abraham and Abimelech

#### Introduction

The record of Sodom and Gomorrah presents one of the most vivid accounts in the Bible of God’s passion for justice and His hatred of evil. While the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were quite prosperous, their inhabitants had come to embrace that which God calls an abomination: homosexuality. While the world today urges tolerance of homosexuality as a valid "alternative lifestyle," the Bible is clear that God condemns it as sin. Sooner or later, sin always results in condemnation and judgment, and the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah was no exception.
Psalm 11:5-7 provides this sobering warning: *"The Lord trieth the righteous: But the wicked and him that loveth violence his soul hateth. Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, And an horrible tempest: this shall be the portion of their cup. For the righteous Lord loveth righteousness; His countenance doth behold the upright."* Amidst the outpouring of His wrath on sinful men, God does not forget His children. His ear is open to the prayer of those who trust in Him, and He is faithful to deliver them.
