### Lesson 12: Abraham, Part 2

* Imputed Righteousness* God's Covenant with Abraham* Hagar and Ishmael* Circumcision* A Son by Sarah

#### Introduction

Abraham was unique among the people of his time because he believed God. When God told him to leave his home country, Abraham obeyed without question. When God promised that he would be the father of a great nation, Abraham honored God by accepting this prophecy as fact, even though he was old and his wife barren. A study of Abraham's life reveals that he not only believed God initially, he also continued in that belief over the course of many years, even when his only assurances were the promises of God.  *"And being not weak in faith, [Abraham] considered not his own body now dead, when he was about an hundred years old, neither yet the deadness of Sarah's womb: He staggered not at the promise of God through unbelief; but was strong in faith, giving glory to God;" (Romans 4:19-20)*
