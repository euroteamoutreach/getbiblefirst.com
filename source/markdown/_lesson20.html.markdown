#### The Seven Pillars of Genesis

Genesis introduces many significant characters, but seven individuals in particular clearly illustrate the Gospel message in story form. These men – Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Joseph – are Genesis&apos; Seven Pillars. Their stories constitute the bulk of the Genesis narrative, each one presenting a different aspect of the Gospel and revealing God&apos;s plan for the salvation of the world.
