#### Introduction

As Abraham's life was drawing to a close, the fulfillment of God's promises was just beginning to unfold. True to His Word, He had given Abraham a miracle child, Isaac, who would now carry on the Messianic line. This lesson recounts the story of God’s extraordinary provision of a wife for Isaac, and the miraculous birth of their children. Isaac's son, Jacob, was particularly chosen by God as the next heir to the promises Abraham had received. Jacob would eventually become the father of God's chosen people: the nation of Israel.
