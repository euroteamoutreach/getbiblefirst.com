### Lesson 6: Adam and Eve

#### Introduction

The Bible is clear that God Himself formed man in His own image and entrusted him with the dominion of the earth and everything in it. Knowing that Adam was incomplete without a mate, God soon provided an ideal companion. He designed the man and woman to perfectly complement each other, achieving mutual happiness and satisfaction in their individual roles. He established marriage as a beautiful picture of the intimate relationship that He desires with each one of us.
