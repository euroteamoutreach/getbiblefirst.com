#### Introduction

The third chapter of Genesis is one of the saddest passages in the Bible. It records a terrible event in human history known to most simply as The Fall - that fateful day when our father Adam turned away from God and plunged humanity into bondage.

The broken existence of sin and depravity that we see today does not reflect God&apos;s initial design. God intended man for glory and righteousness. Tragically, man chose to leave the path of light for a destiny of darkness.

The consequences of what occurred in the Garden of Eden transformed the earth from a realm of innocence and wonder into a world cursed with evil and suffering. Man, who began as a glorious ruler over God&apos;s creation, would now be separated from his Maker.
