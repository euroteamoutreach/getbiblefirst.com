#### Introduction

During Jacob&apos;s final six years in Haran, his wealth increased tremendously as God steadily blessed the flocks in his charge. Although he had suffered cruel deception at the hand of his father-in-law, God protected Jacob, molding his character and continuing to fulfill the promises given to Abraham so many years prior:  *&quot;And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great...&quot; (Genesis 12:2)* Now, after Jacob had labored twenty long years in Laban&apos;s service, God was preparing to lead him back to his homeland.
