### Lesson 17: Jacob, Part 2

* Jacob Departs from Laban* The Mysterious Wrestler* Jacob's Reunion with Esau* The Slaughter of Shechem* Jacob's Twelve Sons

#### Introduction

During Jacob's final six years in Haran, his wealth increased tremendously as God steadily blessed the flocks in his charge. Although he had suffered cruel deception at the hand of his father-in-law, God protected Jacob, molding his character and continuing to fulfill the promises given to Abraham so many years prior:  *"And I will make of thee a great nation, and I will bless thee, and make thy name great..." (Genesis 12:2)* Now, after Jacob had labored twenty long years in Laban's service, God was preparing to lead him back to his homeland.
