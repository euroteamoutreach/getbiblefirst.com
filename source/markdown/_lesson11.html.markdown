### Lesson 11: Abraham, Part 1

* God's Promise to Abraham* Obedience by Faith* The Journey into Egypt* Abraham and Lot* Melchizedek

#### Introduction

One of the most significant figures in the Bible is Abraham. Scripture records that, *"...Abraham believed God, and it was imputed unto him for righteousness: and he was called the Friend of God." (James 2:23)* At first glance, this statement might seem odd, for Abraham was not the wisest nor the most righteous of Biblical characters. In fact, he made some serious mistakes which brought about lasting consequences. But the key statement about Abraham in the verse above is this: *"...Abraham believed God..."* It was not his own merit, but rather his faith in God which set Abraham apart. He trusted God and was willing to follow Him anywhere, even when he did not understand where he was going or why. God chose Abraham above all others to be the father of His people, the nation of Israel, and it was through this line that God ultimately sent the Savior of all mankind: the Lord Jesus Christ.
